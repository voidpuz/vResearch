# Chapter 2: Basic Commands and Directory Hierarchy

The exercises are from the following topics:
- Basic navigation
- File and directory manipulation
- Viewing file content
- Searching and filtering
- Understanding permissions
- Working with commands and help systems

---

### üîç Filesystem Navigation & Inspection

**1. Map Your Filesystem:** Use `tree`, `ls`, `cd`, and `pwd` to draw (on paper or a text file) a hierarchy map of your home directory and `/etc`.
Done

**2. Breadcrumb Trail:** Navigate deep into `/usr`, then use `pwd` to echo your current path. Exit back step-by-step using `cd ..` only.
Done

**3. Hidden Treasures:** List all hidden files in your home directory. What do `.bashrc` and `.profile` do?
Answer: `.bashrc` is a configuration applied when we open a new bash shell. `.profile` is a configuration applied while logging into the system, either using SSH or other. It is a global configuration for all later opened shells.

**4. Find Me If You Can:** Use `find` to search for all `.conf` files under `/etc` (e.g., `find /etc -name "*.conf"`). Count them.
Done

### üìÅ File & Directory Operations

**5. Directory Lab:** Create a directory structure: `projects/linux/basics/{scripts,notes,logs}` using one command.
Done (`mkdir -p`)

**6. Log the Logs:** Use `touch` to create 5 fake log files named `log1.log`, `log2.log`... etc., in the `logs` folder.
Done (using for loop)
```bash
for i in {1..6}; do touch ./projects/linux/basics/logs/log$i.txt; done
```

**7. Bulk Renamer:** Rename all `.log` files to `.txt` using a `for` loop.
```bash
for i in {1..6}; do mv log$i.log log$i.txt; done
```

**8. Copycat:** Copy `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf` into your notes folder. Don‚Äôt overwrite existing ones.
Done

**9. Clean Sweep:** Delete all `.txt` files in logs, but only after confirming their count.
> Requires Bash Script knowledge, later

### üìÑ File Content & Redirection

**10. Who‚Äôs Talking?** Use `echo` to write a sentence to a file called `hello.txt`, then view it with `cat`, `less`, and `head`.
Done

**11. Copy & Compare:** Duplicate a file and use `diff` to show they‚Äôre the same. Modify the copy slightly and compare again.
Done

**12. Combiner:** Create 3 small `.txt` files with different content. Use `cat` to combine them into a new file.
```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > res.txt
```

**13. Line Count Challenge:** Create a file with 20 lines. Use `wc`, `head`, and `tail` to count and extract specific lines.
```bash
wc -l etc_tree.txt
```

**14.Output Redirect Mastery:** Use `>` to write and `>>` to append to a file. Create a log tracking what you learn each day.
Done

### üîß Process, Help, and History

**15. Man Page Explorer:** Read the `man` page for `ls`, `grep`, `find`, and `bash`. Summarize one cool option for each.
Done

**16. Reverse Search Detective:** Use `reverse-i-search (Ctrl+R)` to find a command you ran earlier. Re-run it.
```bash
# CTRL+R causes to open reverse-i-search window
(reverse-i-search)`u': while [true]; do
```

**17. Your Command Diary:** Use `history` to see your command list. Filter it using `grep` for commands like `cd`, `mkdir`, etc.
Done

**18. Get Me Help Fast:** Use `--help` and `man` to learn the difference between `ls --help` and `man ls`.
Answer: I concluded that `--help` is for usage details, command options. `man` is for full documentation.


### üîê Permissions & Ownership

**19. Create a new user and group:** 
- Create a new user named `linuxuser` with the command `sudo useradd linuxuser`
- Create a new group named `linuxgroup` with the command `sudo groupadd linuxgroup`
- Add the `linuxuser` to the `linuxgroup` with the command `sudo usermod -aG linuxgroup linuxuser`
Done

**20. Create files and directories as the new user:** 
- Switch to the `linuxuser` account with the command `su - linuxuser`
- Create a new directory named `mydir` in the `/home/linuxuser` directory
- Create a new file named `myfile.txt` in the `mydir` directory
- Create a new file named `anotherfile.txt` in the `/home/linuxuser` directory

**21. Change ownership and permissions**
- Switch back to your original user account with the command `exit`
- Change the ownership of the `mydir` directory to the root user with the command `sudo chown root:root /home/linuxuser/mydir`
- Change the permissions of the `myfile.txt` file to read-only for the owner with the command `sudo chmod 400 /home/linuxuser/mydir/myfile.txt`
- Try to edit the `myfile.txt` file as the `linuxuser` account with the command `su - linuxuser; nano mydir/myfile.txt` (you should get a permission denied error)

**22. Change group ownership and permissions**
- Change the group ownership of the `anotherfile.txt` file to the `linuxgroup` group with the command `sudo chgrp linuxgroup /home/linuxuser/anotherfile.txt`
- Change the permissions of the `anotherfile.txt` file to read-write for the group with the command `sudo chmod 660 /home/linuxuser/anotherfile.txt`
- Try to edit the `anotherfile.txt` file as a member of the `linuxgroup` group with the command `su - linuxuser; nano anotherfile.txt` (you should be able to edit the file)

**23. Use sudo to change ownership and permissions**
- Use `sudo` to change the ownership of the `mydir` directory back to the `linuxuser` account with the command `sudo chown linuxuser:linuxuser /home/linuxuser/mydir`
- Use `sudo` to change the permissions of the `myfile.txt` file to read-write for the owner with the command `sudo chmod 600 /home/linuxuser/mydir/myfile.txt`
- Try to edit the `myfile.txt` file as the `linuxuser` account with the command `su - linuxuser; nano mydir/myfile.txt` (you should be able to edit the file)

Done!
